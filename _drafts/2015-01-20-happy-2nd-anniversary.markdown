<h3>Happy Anniverary Emily Elizabeth!</h3>
<p>(This first part is literally about Clifford, I told you so.)</p>
<img src="/images/clifford.jpg">
<p>Look! It’s Emily Elizabeth, and her good pal, Clifford. They’re hanging out together on the beach. It's basically just like our relationship. I photoshopped this picture to help you understand a little better...</p>
<img src="/images/clifford-edit.jpg">
<p>SEE?!</p>
<p>You are Emily Elizabeth, and I am your Clifford. What am I talking about?! Well basically boyfriends and dogs are 99% the same.</p>
<p>I protect you, I hurt people who are mean to you. I give you kisses when you cry, and lick your tears. I wait all week for you to come home, and I run and jump on you when you get to the apartment. I also touch your butt (dogs sniff your butt) a lot. And sometimes I bite you. ;) I play with you and keep you happy. I drive you places so we can do fun things...wait, no I guess dogs don't do that. I stay loyal and stand by your side until I die.</p>
<p>You own me, I am yours. You give me food and buy me things that I need. You make sure I stay healthy and don't run out into traffic. You love me and hug me and give me lots of kisses.</p>
<p>I like being your dog. I never want to be anyone else's dog.</p>
<p>Happy Second Anniversary Emily Elizabeth :D</p>

<hr>

<h3>The part where I stop calling you Emily</h3>
<p>It's so weird calling you Emily Elizabeth. You know how when people say their vows at weddings and stuff? And they always say the person's full name? I don't know what I'm going to do. I'll probably just say Emma Hollinger.</p>

<h3>A recap of 2014</h3>
<p>It's cool that our anniversary is right at the beginning of the year. It's almost like a New Year's celebration for our relationship. EMMA AND SHANE 2015!</p>

<h3>What happened this year?</h3>
<p>It will be fun to read this letter in a few years, and look back on all the fun memories we had in 2014. So I'm just going to talk about all the fun (and not so fun) things that happened. I guess that's the point of an anniversary letter anyways. Tell the other person you love them, and look back on the previous year of the relationship. Talk about the future years to come.</p>
<p>This previous year began with our first anniversary. That was fun.</p>
<p>I was living at my parent's house and got kicked out for having LSD. I moved in with Chris and Steve in the middle of the woods. I worked at the Roasted Red Pepper and that was dumb.</p>
<p>You did not get kicked out of your house, and you worked at the Village Preschool. Amelia and you were best friends but then she left. She's moving on to the WNBA. You still see her sometimes when you babysit for her. Speaking of babysitting, you won several awards this year for babysitting more than any human ever in history.</p>
<p>We didn't really fight this year. So that was cool. Maybe in future years, fighting will be a thing we do more often. But for right now, we keep it to a minimal :D</p>
<p>We thought you were pregnant. But you obviously weren't. So that was a relief!</p>
<p>We went on vacation together to Delaware. We went with Andrea and your Mom. You want to move there and live next to the beach. You wanted to be on the beach 24/7. We stayed with your Uncle Kevin and he had us sleep in different rooms. You, Andrea, and I hung out a lot. That was cool because her and I never really hung out before that, so it was cool getting to know her. Your mom made up tons of words. Splurge! Trounce. We walked around on the boardwalk, and went for walks on the beach together. We spent some quality time in a lifeguards chair ;) Also, there was that one night where we tried to find a restaurant to eat at. But they were all closed. So then we stopped at two different grocery stores to find food. And nobody talked in the car ride home (except for MB, she was just spewing nonsense from her mouth to try and break the silence), and I noticed going on vacation with three females probably wasn't the best idea. And then we got back to the house and I almost burnt my pizza. You didn't talk to me the entire night. It was terrible. But now I know that I need to keep you happy and well-fed :) All in all, it was a really awesome vacation.</p>
<p>You got your ears pierced like 25 times while we were in Delaware. It was the beginning of a deep-seeded addiction. I'm sure by now your ears are filled with pounds and pounds of metal.</p>
<p>We also went to Massachusetts. I had to google that, I can never spell Massachusetts correctly. But I did it on my first try this time. Massachusetts was fun :) Lots of beach and little shops and shit like that. We went and met up with my Aunt Tracy at the beach. Her and your mom hung out and talked. We buried her kids in the sand. Noah was there too.</p>
<p>We went to Quincy Market and the Boston Aquarium. I bought my first pair of sunglasses ever in my life...well, your mom bought them. We also went to a cool record store and sat on the floor for probably like an hour. Massachusetts was the first time I realized that you could have withdrawl effects from weed, and I had nightmares and was on my period sometimes. :P OH! And we saw a fucking goat being walked on a leash through that little town.</p>
<p>We also did that photoshoot with my family at the Schodack Town Park. My aunt Sarah captured an accidental picture of me pretending to jump into your arms. It's hands down the best photo of us ever.</p>

<p>The rest of this is just random ramblings. I love you.</p>

<h3>Our House</h3>
<p>I'm excited to live with you. I don't know how far in the future that will be. Hunter is saying that he wants to move to Colorado when our lease is up in Cohoes. I'm definitely not moving to Colorado. Maybe we could get an apartment together or something. I don't know what I'll do yet. But it will be closer to Emma. Cohoes is too far away.</p>
<p>Living together is going to be the coolest. We are going to drive each other INSANE. I can't wait. :D</p>
<p>We are going to have a really cool house. I'm going to make a section on this Emma/Shane website where we can post ideas/inspiration for our house.</p>

<h3>Movies</h3>
<p>I really really like our little stay-at-home movie dates. It's so inexpensive, and we can get naked and talk during the movie. And we can bring as much food and drinks as we want. And we can lay in a bed while we watch the movie. I'm really surprised that more couples don't do this, because it's probably my favorite 'type of date' ever.</p>
<p>I really like watching (good) movies with you. Wes Anderson is cool. We just got done watching The Grand Budapest Hotel AND Moonrise Kingdom. You should send me movies that look good, and I can download them and we can watch them on the weekends when you come over. Jake was telling me how he's worried that movies will stop being made, or just start becoming shitty sequels, because all the good movie ideas are taken. I told him that books have been around for way longer. I think an abundance of shitty movies, is just going to make it easier to find the really fantastic movies.</p>

<h3>My survival</h3>
<p>You always say how you wouldn't be alive if we didn't meet. I think the same goes for me. I can't imagine my life without you. I would probably be some poor junkie living on the streets somewhere, or something, I don't know. You buy me lots of nice things and help me financially, and I really appreciate that. You keep me out of trouble as much as you can, and you keep me healthy. You help make me happy, not many things do that, so, thank you.</p>

<h3>Commas and parentheses</h3>
<p>Do I use them too much? I think I do. It's just how I organize my thoughts. I like to use commas (,), parentheses (()), and forward slashes (/) a lot.</p>

<h3>Sleeping next to you</h3>
<p>I'm laying next to you in bed right now typing this. It's 2:26 AM. You do snore. It's more like loud breathing, not really snoring. Okay, wait, nope, now you are snoring. Now it stopped. You are one crazy lady. :D About every 20 minutes, you'll roll over to your other side to change positions. You will bump into me, and open your eyes a little and look at the computer screen and go back to sleep. It's kinda silly.</p>

<h3>Things I want to do in 2015</h3>
<p>Let's make 2015 a more memorable year, that way our 3rd anniversary letters can be even cooler :P Woahhhh Three Years?!</p>
<p>I'm so excited to vacation with your for real this year. I want to go on a roadtrip very much. I literally can't wait *gets in car and drives far far away*. I'm excited to go to Maine with you. I want to show you York Beach where we used to vacation. I want to show you the York Beach lighthouse.</p>
<p>Also in 2015 we should eat mushrooms and go ride go-karts at Funplex. We'll need someone to drive us there. Probably Tim. We can not tell him that we took shrooms, and we can pay for him to ride the go-karts.</p>
<p>Also in 2015, we will start using the official Emma & Shane website! We are gonna be so cool :P I bet most other couples don't have secret password-protected websites where they can communicate and share secrets!</p>

<h3>I love you.</h3>
<p>When we first said 'I love you' to each other, it was scary. It was difficult to say. It's not difficult to say anymore. I can tell it still scares you a little, and that's really freaking cute. But just because I'm not scared or shaky when I say it, doesn't mean I don't mean it. I still mean it just as much as the first time I said it. Everytime I tell you I love you, I mean it. It's not just some thing I say. I really fucking mean it, every single time. I mean it so much, I just said the word 'fucking' :O and I never say that lol.</p>
<p>I guess that's all I'm really trying to say with this letter. I (fucking) love you Emma.</p>

<hr>

<h3>The End</h3>
<p>Happy Anniversary #2 of 5, here's to 3 more years together! lol.</p>
<p>Love, Shane</p>

<p><b>P.S.</b> I just checked to see who's letter was longer. Yours was 912 words. Mine was two times as long, not including this post salutation. I WIN.</p>
